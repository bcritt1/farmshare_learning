This repository is a collection of scripts made to run on Stanford's Sherlock and Farmshare clusters. A single repo, the Farmshare scripts can be accessed as branches of the default Sherlock scripts. If you are in a web browser, you can just use the drop down in each sub-repo to switch between the branches. On Sherlock and Farmshare, the the repos are already checked out to the corrected branches. If you've cloned this repo to local, you can switch to the Farmshare scripts with the syntax

```bash
git checkout fs_RepoName
```
where the repo name is the specific repo you are in.
